<h1>Assignment 3 - Skyrail (Data Driven Design)</h1>

<p id="text_box">

GENERAL
<br>
The Skyrail is a monorail system that connects Sydney CBD to the newly developed Parramatta CBD. Parramatta is being given $8 Billion to develop it into New South Wales’ second CBD.
<br>
<br>
PROBLEMS
<br>
Even though the new Parramatta CBD will introduce new jobs and opportunities for people to find more high paying jobs, compared to the Sydney CBD it can’t compete especially at its birth. Therefore there will still be people with jobs in the Sydney CBD even though they live in Parramatta. Once it is complete there will be a great increase in the population density in Parramatta due to the introduction of high rise apartments and the increase in jobs. Yet the traffic in Sydney is already a major problem which the government can never seem to resolve and is therefore the main problem that the Skyrail seeks to solve. How do you provide the people with a way to travel between these cities, without adding to the traffic in Sydney which will only get worse?
<br>
<br>
POSITIVES OF THE SKYRAIL
<br>
The Skyrail has the potential to reduce the traffic on the road caused by people coming in and out from Parramatta. And therefore it will provide an alternate to using cars which will reduce the amount of cars on the road and the impact environmentally of all those extra cars.
<br>
<br>
DESCRIBING THE MAP
<br>
The Skyrail has extra branches coming off the sides of it that work similarly to an exit on a highway, allowing the users to travel to other places along the way and reducing one of it’s limitations. <br><br> These locations are seen as popular or important places between Sydney and Parramatta such as Sydney Airport and Bankstown Airport, UWS, ACU, USYD, etc. 
<br><br>
POTENTIAL PROBLEMS 
<br>
The main problem with the Skyrail would be it’s intrusiveness to the sky where it can be seen. And also how will it be powered? We have come to the conclusion that we would make the top of the object out of solar panels due to the fact that it is high up, and we made the shape a pipe which will be the smallest shape we could make that would have less of an impact on the ground. Yet it is understood that in this design there will always be an impact on the ground. 
<br>
<br>
The design is also a statement to how the government hasn’t been able to find a solution to the traffic problem and says that this is the type of ridiculous system you would have to implement to potentially improve the situation.
