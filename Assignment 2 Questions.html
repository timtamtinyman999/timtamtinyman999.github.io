<h1>Assignment 2 (Data vis on Mapbox)</h1>

<p id="text_box">WHAT IS THE DATASET AND WHY IS IT COLLECTED?
<br>
Unpaid Domestic Work: Number of House by Age by Sex. Meaning the hours of unpaid domestic work per week by age and sex. The data is collected to understand why location and other factors have an impact on the amount of unpaid domestic work done by people.
<br>
<br>
WHICH GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT DO YOU THINK WILL USE THIS?
<br>
NSW Department of Family and Community Services and NSW Department of  Finance,Services and Innovation as the data focuses on household data and this can be related to household income.
<br>
<br>
WHICH PRIVATE SECTOR WILL USE THIS?
<br>
Products that target the home and domestic work such as chores, such as household cleaning products and appliances that would be counted as unpaid domestic work.
<br>
<br>
HOW WOULD THIS DATASET CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT SPACE?
<br>

The unpaid domestic work dataset changed the landscape of nsw in by dividing it into areas where people can afford to stay home, such as being a stay at home mum, and people who can’t afford to stay home.
<br>
<br>
HOW DOES THIS DATASET CHANGE ACROSS SYDNEY?
<br>
The richer areas had more people who did more hours of unpaid domestic work and and the poorer areas had less people doing unpaid domestic works.
<br>
<br>
HOW DOES IT RELATE TO THE LATTE LINE?
<br>
The latte drinking side of the latte line has people doing more hours of unpaid domestic work than on the other side. This is quite evident in the data representations we have found. We believe that this can be attributed to families who can afford to have a parent or partner living at home and the other working, so therefore the person staying at home would be doing more unpaid work. On the other side of the latte line people who can’t afford to have one person staying at home would therefore have less hours to spend doing unpaid domestic work.
<br>
<br>
HOW HAS THE DATASET CHANGED BETWEEN 2011 AND 2016?
<br>
There are only really small changes and these could be contributed to the fact that areas can’t really change and the differences in incomes haven’t changed enough to see any noticeable change to the unpaid domestic work dataset
<br>
<br>
HOW IS THIS DATASET SIGNIFICANT TO PEOPLE'S LIVES?
<br>
It has the ability to show class and gender divisions in a way that most people wouldn’t think of.
<br>
<br>
WOULD IT BE GOOD FOR THIS DATA TO CHANGE?
<br>
It would be good if there was more of a balance in the data rather than such a distinct trend that relates to the latte line and gender.
<br>
<br>
WHY WE CHOSE TO EXPLORE THIS SET OF DATA
<br>
When looking at the dataset it is set out splitting up genders, so therefore we decided to explore the difference between genders. It is clear through the gifs that the difference is very noticeable. Then through further exploration of the data we found that the latte line could be shown through the visual representation and therefore we chose to implement the income per household to see if there was any specific trends through that</p>
