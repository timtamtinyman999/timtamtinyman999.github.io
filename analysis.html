<h1>Unpaid Domestic Work: Number of Hours by Age by Sex</h1>

<p id="text_box">The gifs highlight a significant change in the data between male and female for the different groups of hours found in the dataset. This could be due to more mothers having to stay at home to raise their children and traditionally females being the ones who do the domestic housework.</p>
<br>
<p id="text_box">Female to male less than 5 hours
The amount of hours here is less than men but this is because it is only counting for less than five hours which most men would classify themselves as.</p>

<p id="text_box">Female to male 5 to 14 hours
This gif shows that the 5 to 14 hours bracket is where the genders are quite equal but showing where the males max out.</p>

<p id="text_box">Female to Male 14 to 29 hours
This gif illustrates a dramatic difference between the females that are represented in the darker colours and the males shown in the lighter colours. The lighter colours represent the lower half of this bracket and therefore show that the males are on the opposite side of the scale to the females when it comes to this time bracket.</p>

<p id="text_box">Female to male more than 30 hours
More than 30 hours represents the same trend as the 14 to 29 hour map. What is interesting here is that the north coast of NSW has an influx of males who do more hours. This could potentially be due to it being a richer area with more stay at home dads or other males.</p>
